# JavaScript-Password-Generator
This application is coded using JavaScript to generate passwords with parameters set by the user. The user selects a length of password by typing in a numeric value between 10 and 64. They then select which types of character to include (upper case, lower case, numeric and special characters). The program then randomly generates a password based on the given requirements.
